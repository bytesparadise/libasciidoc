= Contributing to the project

This is the contribute.md of our project. Great to have you here. Here are a few ways you can help make this project better!

== Adding new features

Please open an issue https://github.com/bytesparadise/libasciidoc/issues[here] to discuss about the feature you would like to see in Libasciidoc, 
If you're in the mood to implement it (that's awesome!), then submit a pull-request along with enough tests (both at the parser level and at the renderer level) to validate the behaviour of your code.

Donâ€™t get discouraged if you don't get an immediate response, this is a side-project.

== Bug triage

* You can help report bugs by filing them https://github.com/bytesparadise/libasciidoc/issues[here]. 

* You can help us diagnose and fix existing bugs by asking and providing answers for the following:
** Is the bug reproducible as explained?   
** Are the steps to reproduce the bug clear? If not, can you describe how you might reproduce it?  
** What tags should the bug have?  
** Is this bug something you have run into? Would you appreciate it being looked into faster?  

* You can close fixed bugs by testing old tickets to see if they are still happening.
* You can update our changelog here:
* You can remove duplicate bug reports by:
