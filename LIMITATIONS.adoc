== Quoted Text

Quoted text rendering can differ in the following cases:

- when the punctuation is unbalanced. Eg:
```
some **bold content*.
```
will be rendered as the raw input:
```
some **bold content*.
```
instead of :
```
<p>some <strong>*bold content</strong></p>
```

- when quoted text uses the same punctuation. Eg:
```
*some *nested bold* content*.
```
Libasciidoc will detect the nested bold quote and renderer accordingly:
```
<strong>some <strong>nested bold</strong> content</strong>.
```
whereas Asciidoc/Asciidoctor will produce :
```
<p><strong>some *nested bold</strong> content*.</p>
```
