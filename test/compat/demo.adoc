This is a demonstration of {library} {libasciidoc-version}.
And this is the preamble of this document.

[[purpose]]
.Purpose
****
This document exercises many of the features of AsciiDoc to test the {library} implementation.
****

TIP: If you want the HTML to have the familiar AsciiDoc Python style, load the asciidoc.css stylesheet using the CLI option `-a stylesheet=asciidoc.css`.

== First Steps with AsciiDoc

.Inline markup
* underlines around a phrase place _emphasis_
* astericks around a phrase make the text *bold*
* double astericks around one or more **l**etters in a word make those letters bold
* double underscore around a __sub__string in a word emphasizes that substring
* use carrots around characters to make them ^super^script
* use tildes around characters to make them ~sub~script
ifdef::basebackend-html[* to pass through +++<b>HTML</b>+++ directly, surround the text with triple plus]
ifdef::basebackend-docbook[* to pass through +++<constant>XML</constant>+++ directly, surround the text with triple plus]

// separate two adjacent lists using a line comment (only the leading // is required)

- characters can be escaped using a {backslash}
* for instance, you can escape a quote inside emphasized text like _Here\'s Johnny!_
- you can safely use reserved XML characters like <, > and &, which are escaped when converting
- force a space{sp}between inline elements using the \{sp} attribute
- hold text together with an intrinsic non-breaking{nbsp}space attribute, \{nbsp}
- handle words with unicode characters like in the name Gregory RomÃ©
- claim your copyright (C), registered trademark (R) or trademark (TM)
- select menu:View[Zoom > Reset] to reset the zoom

You can write text https://example.com[with inline links], optionally{sp}using
an explicit link:https://example.com[link prefix]. In either case, the link can
have a https://example.com?foo=fighters&lang=en[query string].

If you want to break a line +
just end it in a {plus} sign +
and continue typing on the next line.

=== Lists Upon Lists

.Adjacent lists
* this list
* should join

* to have
* four items

ifdef::env-github[]
++++
<a name="ordered"></a>
++++
endif::env-github[]

[[ordered]]
.Ordered lists
. These items
. will be auto-numbered
.. and can be nested
. A numbered list can nest
* unordered
* list
* items

.Statement
I swear I left it in _Guy\'s_ car. Let\'s go look for it.

[[defs]]
term::
  definition
line two
[[another_term]]another term::

  another definition, which can be literal (indented) or regular paragraph

This should be a standalone paragraph, not grabbed by the definition list.

[[nested]]
* first level
written on two lines
* first level
+
....
with this literal text
....

* first level
+
 with more literal text

** second level
*** third level
- fourth level
* back to +
first level

// this is just a comment

Let's make a horizontal rule...

'''

then take a break.

We'll be right with you...

after this brief interruption.

== ...and we're back!

Do you want to see a image:tiger.png[Tiger,50]?

Do you feel safer with the tiger in a box?

=== Block Quotes and "`Smart`" Ones

____
AsciiDoc is _so_ *powerful*!
____

This verse comes to mind.

[verse]
La la la

Here's another quote:

[quote, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]
____
When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains,
however improbable, must be the truth.
____

"`Get moving!`" he shouted.

== Getting Literal [[literally]]

 Want to get literal? Just prefix a line with a space (just 1 space will do).

....
I'll join that party, too.
....

We forgot to mention in <<ordered>> that you can change the numbering style.

.. first item (yeah!)
.. second item, looking `so mono`
.. third item, `mono` it is!

// This attribute line will get reattached to the next block
// despite being followed by a trailing blank line
[id='wrapup']

== Wrap-up

NOTE: AsciiDoc is quite cool, you should try it!
