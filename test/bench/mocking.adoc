synopsis: Quarkus 1.4 introduces some interesting new capabilities for mocking CDI beans.

Testing Quarkus applications has been an important part of the Quarkus Developer Joy, which is why
`@QuarkusTest` for testing JVM applications and `@NativeTest` for black-box testing of the native images have been
part of Quarkus since the first release.
A recurring request however amongst our community members has been to have Quarkus allow them to selectively
mock certain CDI beans for specific tests. This post will introduce the new mocking capabilities
that `1.4` brings which aim to address those concerns, while also providing a glimpse of additional
improvements in this are that will be part of `1.5`.

== Old approach

Let us assume that a Quarkus application contains the following (purely contrived) bean:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class OrderService {

    private final InvoiceService invoiceService;
    private final InvoiceNotificationService invoiceNotificationService;

    public OrderService(InvoiceService invoiceService, InvoiceNotificationService invoiceNotificationService) {
        this.invoiceService = invoiceService;
        this.invoiceNotificationService = invoiceNotificationService;
    }

    public Invoice generateSendInvoice(Long orderId) {
        final Invoice invoice = invoiceService.generateForOrder(orderId);
        if (invoice.isAlreadySent()) {
            invoiceNotificationService.sendInvoice(invoice);
        } else {
            invoiceNotificationService.notifyInvoiceAlreadySent(invoice);
        }
        return invoice;
    }
}
----

When testing the `generateSendInvoice` method we most likely don't want to use the actual `InvoiceNotificationService` as it would
result in sending real notifications. With the old Quarkus approach one could "override"
the `InvoiceNotificationService` in tests by adding the following bean in the test sources:

[source,java]
----
@Mock
public class MockInvoiceNotificationService implements InvoiceNotificationService {

    public void sendInvoice(Invoice invoice) {

    }

    public void notifyInvoiceAlreadySent(Invoice invoice) {

    }
}
----

When Quarkus scanned this code, the use of `@Mock` would result in `MockInvoiceNotificationService` being used as
the implementation of `InvoiceNotificationService` in every place where a `InvoiceNotificationService` bean was injected
(in CDI terms this is called an injection point).

Although this mechanism is fairly straightforward to use, it nonetheless suffers from a few problems:

* A new class (or a new CDI producer method) needs to be used for each bean type that requires a mock. In a large application where a lot of
mocks are needed, the amount of boilerplate code increases unacceptably.
* There is no way for a mock to be used for certain tests only. This is due to the fact that beans that are annotated with `@Mock` are normal
CDI beans (and are therefore used throughout the application).
Depending on what needs to be tested, this can be very problematic.
* There is a no out of the box integration with https://site.mockito.org/[Mockito], which is the de-facto standard for
mocking in Java applications. Users can certainly use Mockito (most commonly by using a CDI producer method), but there
is boilerplate code involved.

== New approach

Starting with Quarkus `1.4`, users have the ability to create and inject per-test mocks for normal scoped CDI beans using
`io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusMock`. Moreover, Quarkus provides out of the box integration with Mockito
allowing for zero effort mocking of CDI beans using the `io.quarkus.test.junit.mockito.@InjectMock` annotation.

=== Using QuarkusMock

`QuarkusMock` provides the foundation for mocking normal scoped CDI beans and is also used under the hood by `@InjectMock`, so let us examine
it first. The best way to do this is using an example:

[source,java]
----
@QuarkusTest
public class MockTestCase {

    @Inject
    MockableBean1 mockableBean1;

    @Inject
    MockableBean2 mockableBean2;

    @BeforeAll
    public static void setup() {
        MockableBean1 mock = Mockito.mock(MockableBean1.class);  // <1>
        Mockito.when(mock.greet("Stuart")).thenReturn("A mock for Stuart");
        QuarkusMock.installMockForType(mock, MockableBean1.class);  // <2>
    }

    @Test
    public void testBeforeAll() {
        Assertions.assertEquals("A mock for Stuart", mockableBean1.greet("Stuart"));  // <3>
        Assertions.assertEquals("Hello Stuart", mockableBean2.greet("Stuart")); // <4>
    }

    @Test
    public void testPerTestMock() {
        QuarkusMock.installMockForInstance(new BonjourMockableBean2(), mockableBean2); // <5>
        Assertions.assertEquals("A mock for Stuart", mockableBean1.greet("Stuart"));  // <6>
        Assertions.assertEquals("Bonjour Stuart", mockableBean2.greet("Stuart")); // <7>
    }

    @ApplicationScoped
    public static class MockableBean1 {

        public String greet(String name) {
            return "Hello " + name;
        }
    }

    @ApplicationScoped
    public static class MockableBean2 {

        public String greet(String name) {
            return "Hello " + name;
        }
    }

    public static class BonjourMockableBean2 extends MockableBean2 {
        @Override
        public String greet(String name) {
            return "Bonjour " + name;
        }
    }
}
----
<1> This part of the  example uses Mockito for convenience's sake only. `QuarkusMock` is not tied to Mockito in any way.
<2> We use `QuarkusMock.installMockForType()` because the injected bean instance is not yet available. Very important to note is that
the mock setup in a JUnit `@BeforeAll` method, is used for *all* test methods of the class (other test classes are *not* affected by this).
<3> The mock for `MockableBean1` is being used as it was defined for all test methods of the class.
<4> Since no mock has been set up for `MockableBean2`, the CDI bean is being used.
<5> We use `QuarkusMock.installMockForInstance()` here because inside the test method, the injected bean instance is available.
<6> The mock for `MockableBean1` is being used as it was defined for all test methods of the class.
<7> As we used `BonjourMockableBean2` as a mock `MockableBean2`, this class is now used.

[IMPORTANT]
====
`QuarkusMock` can be used for any normal scoped CDI bean - the most common of which are `@ApplicationScoped` and `@RequestScoped`.
This means that beans with `@Singleton` and `@Dependent` scope *cannot* be used with `QuarkusMock`.

Furthermore, `QuarkusMock` will not work properly when it's used in tests that run parallel in the same JVM.
====

Returning to the original example of the blog post, we could get rid of the `MockInvoiceNotificationService` class and
instead use something like the following:

[source,java]
----
public class OrderServiceTest {

    @Inject
    OrderService orderService;

    @BeforeAll
    public static void setup() {
        MockableBean1 mock = Mockito.mock(InvoiceNotificationService.class);
        Mockito.doNothing().when(mock).sendInvoice(any());
        Mockito.doNothing().when(mock).notifyInvoiceAlreadySent(any());
        QuarkusMock.installMockForType(mock, MockableBean1.class);
    }

    public void testGenerateSendInvoice() {
        // perform some setup

        Invoice invoice = orderService.generateSendInvoice(1L);

        // perform some assertions
    }
}
----

Note that in this case we don't need to create a new class implementing `InvoiceNotificationService`.
Moreover, we have full and per test control over the mock, something which grants up a lot of flexibility when writing tests.

For example, if we had some other test where we did want to use the real `InvoiceNotificationService`, then in that test
we would simply not do any mocking of `InvoiceNotificationService`.

If yet another test needed to mock `InvoiceNotificationService` in some other way, then it would be perfectly free to do so,
using the same method `OrderServiceTest` uses, without causing any problems to the other tests.

Finally, note in the example above we didn't mock `InvoiceService`, which meant that the real `InvoiceService` was being used in `OrderServiceTest`.

=== Using @InjectMock

Hopefully the previous section convinced you of the merits of `QuarkusMock` over the old approach. You might also be wondering
however if there is a way to reduce boilerplate code even further and provide tighter integration with Mockito. That is
where `@InjectMock` comes in handy.

To demonstrate `@InjectMock` let's rewrite the `MockTestCase` from the previous section.

First of all, we need to add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-junit5-mockito</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

Now we can rewrite the `MockTestCase` like so:

[source,java]
----
@QuarkusTest
public class MockTestCase {

    @InjectMock
    MockableBean1 mockableBean1; // <1>

    @InjectMock
    MockableBean2 mockableBean2;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setup() {
        Mockito.when(mockableBean1.greet("Stuart")).thenReturn("A mock for Stuart"); // <2>
    }

    @Test
    public void firstTest() {
        Assertions.assertEquals("A mock for Stuart", mockableBean1.greet("Stuart"));
        Assertions.assertEquals(null, mockableBean2.greet("Stuart"));
    }

    @Test
    public void secondTest() {
        Mockito.when(mockableBean2.greet("Stuart")).thenReturn("Bonjour Stuart"); // <3>
        Assertions.assertEquals("A mock for Stuart", mockableBean1.greet("Stuart"));
        Assertions.assertEquals("Bonjour Stuart", mockableBean2.greet("Stuart"));
    }

    @ApplicationScoped
    public static class MockableBean1 {

        public String greet(String name) {
            return "Hello " + name;
        }
    }

    @ApplicationScoped
    public static class MockableBean2 {

        public String greet(String name) {
            return "Hello " + name;
        }
    }
}
----
<1> `@InjectMock` results in a mock being created and being available in *all* test methods of the test class (other test classes are *not* affected by this)
<2> The `mockableBean1` is configured here for all test methods of the class
<3> Configure `mockableBean2` for this test only

[NOTE]
====
Since `@InjectMock` uses `QuarkusMock` under the hood, the same limitations apply to its use.

Additionally, `@InjectMock` works like an injection point for the bean, so for it to work properly when
the target bean uses CDI qualifiers, those qualifiers also need to be added to the field.
We will see an example of this in next section about mocking a `@RestClient` bean.
====

As a final example, we can rewrite the `OrderServiceTest` test like so:

[source,java]
----
public class OrderServiceTest {

    @Inject
    private OrderService orderService;

    @InjectMock
    private InvoiceNotificationService invoiceNotificationService;

    @BeforeAll
    public static void setup() {
        doNothing().when(invoiceNotificationService).sendInvoice(any());
        doNothing().when(invoiceNotificationService).notifyInvoiceAlreadySent(any());
    }

    public void testGenerateSendInvoice() {
        // perform some setup

        Invoice invoice = orderService.generateSendInvoice(1L);

        // perform some assertions
    }
}
----

==== Using @InjectMock with @RestClient

A very common need is to mock `@RestClient` beans. Thankfully it's a need well covered by `@InjectMock` - as long
as two principles are followed:

* The bean is made `@ApplicationScoped` (instead of accepting the default scope which `@RegisterRestClient` implies, i.e. `@Dependent`)
* The `@RestClient` CDI qualifier is used when injecting the bean into the test.

As usual, an example best demonstrates these requirements. Say we have a `GreetingService` which we wish to use to build a rest client:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/")
@ApplicationScoped  // <1>
@RegisterRestClient
public interface GreetingService {

    @GET
    @Path("/hello")
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    String hello();
}
----
<1> `@ApplicationScoped` needs to be used to make `GreetingService` mockable.

An example test class could be:

[source,java]
----
@QuarkusTest
public class GreetingResourceTest {

    @InjectMock
    @RestClient // <1>
    GreetingService greetingService;

    @Test
    public void testHelloEndpoint() {
        Mockito.when(greetingService.hello()).thenReturn("hello from mockito");

        given()
          .when().get("/hello")
          .then()
             .statusCode(200)
             .body(is("hello from mockito"));
    }

}
----
<1> We need to use the `@RestClient` CDI qualifier, since Quarkus creates the `GreetingService` bean with this qualifier.
